# [Exploriments](https://github.com/ankitbhatnagar2012/exploriments)

Exploriments are a series of educational apps aimed to make
learning Physics, really fun and interactive. Moreover, it is developed
entirely in Javascript + HTML5 canvas and is fully touch-enabled for
viewing on mobile devices.

## Demos

* Simple Pendulum & Gravity: [http://ankitbhatnagar.com/exploriments/twoPlanets/](http://ankitbhatnagar.com/exploriments/twoPlanets/)

Observe the behaviour of a simple pendulum by :-

1. Altering the value of acceleration due to gravity by selecting the respective planet / star / satellite.
2. Altering the length of the pendulum. 

* Addition of vectors: [http://ankitbhatnagar.com/exploriments/vectors/](http://ankitbhatnagar.com/exploriments/vectors/)

Observe how addition of multiple vectors is performed by :-

1. Altering the respective angle between two vectors.

2. Altering respective magnitude of vector/s.
